              "'Page: Agentic AI\\nSummary: Agentic AI is a class of artificial intelligence that focuses on autonomous systems that can make decisions and perform tasks with limited or no human intervention. The independent systems automatically respond to conditions to produce process results. The field is closely linked to agentic automation, also known as agent-based process management systems, when applied to process automation. Applications include software development, customer support, cybersecurity and business intelligence.\\n\\nPage: Intelligent agent\\nSummary: In artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent is an entity that perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously to achieve goals, and may improve its performance through machine learning or by acquiring knowledge. AI textbooks define artificial intelligence as the \"study and design of intelligent agents,\" emphasizing that goal-directed behavior is central to intelligence.\\nA specialized subset of intelligent agents, agentic AI (also known as an AI agent or simply agent), expands this concept by proactively pursuing goals, making decisions, and taking actions over extended periods.\\nIntelligent agents can range from simple to highly complex. A basic thermostat or control system is considered an intelligent agent, as is a human being, or any other system that meets the same criteria—such as a firm, a state, or a biome.\\nIntelligent agents operate based on an objective function, which encapsulates their goals. They are designed to create and execute plans that maximize the expected value of this function upon completion. For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a reward function, which allows programmers to shape its desired behavior. Similarly, an evolutionary algorithm\\'s behavior is guided by a fitness function.\\nIntelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, and the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations.\\nIntelligent agents are often described schematically as abstract functional systems similar to computer programs. To distinguish theoretical models from real-world implementations, abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents. Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents—autonomous computer programs that carry out tasks on behalf of users. They are also referred to using a term borrowed from economics: a \"rational agent\".\\n\\nPage: Vibe coding\\nSummary: Vibe coding is an artificial intelligence-assisted software development technique popularized by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025.\\nThe term was listed in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary the following month as a \"slang & trending\" term.\\nVibe coding describes a chatbot-based approach to creating software where the developer describes a project or task to a large language model (LLM), which generates code based on the prompt. The developer does not review or edit the code, but solely uses tools and execution results to evaluate it and asks the LLM for improvements. Unlike traditional AI-assisted coding or pair programming, the human developer avoids examination of the code, accepts AI-suggested completions without human review, and focuses more on iterative experimentation than code correctness or structure.\\nAdvocates of vibe coding say that it allows even amateur programmers to produce software without the extensive training and skills required for software engineering. Critics point out a lack of accountability, maintainability, and the increased risk of introducing security vulnerabilities in the resulting software.'"
